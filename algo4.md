# IsPalindromeRecursive Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of a recursive algorithm to check if a given word is a palindrome. The algorithm is provided in both pseudo-code and as a step-by-step explanation.

## Algorithm Overview

The `IsPalindromeRecursive` algorithm reads a word from the user and determines whether the word is a palindrome. It utilizes a recursive function called `IsPalindromeCheck` to compare characters at opposite ends of the word.

## Pseudo-Code Algorithm

The pseudo-code algorithm of the "IsPalindromeRecursive" algorithm is outlined in the file `isPalindromeRecursiveAlgorithm.pseudo`. It provides a detailed explanation of the algorithm's steps, including variable declarations, recursion, and palindrome-checking logic.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Study the pseudo-code algorithm in `isPalindromeRecursiveAlgorithm.pseudo` for a thorough understanding of the algorithm's implementation.
3. Implement the algorithm in your preferred programming language using the provided pseudo-code as a reference.

## Example Input and Output

Upon running the algorithm, you will be prompted to enter a word. The algorithm will then determine whether the entered word is a palindrome or not based on the recursive palindrome-checking function.
